# COVID-Visualizer

### Problem/Inspiration
A potential challenge during the pandemic outbreak like COVID-19 is overwhelming hospitals. Right now, hospitals don't have the capacity for a large number of incoming patients. There is a need for a technology platform that is capable of raising awareness for this pandemic and proving it is NOT A MYTH. With people not believing the coronavirus is causing such a pressing issue in the world and lack of masks, vaccines, and quarantine/isolation is a contributing factor of why the coronavirus is still spreading. This web app helps create awareness for those who think that the coronavirus isn't real or doesn't care to take precautionary measures.

### About
This is a simulation of the current pandemic using a polar plot. Instead of x and y coordinates to plot points, it uses theta, r-coordinate pairs to specify points within a unit circle. The main factor is called the basic reproductive number or R0. For an undiscovered disease, such as COVID-19, everyone in the population is vulnerable to it. The basic reproductive number for COVID-19 is estimated to be 2.3, which means that each person infected with the virus will spread it to 2.3 others, on average, over the time the person has their illness. This simulation uses a population of 5,000 people, without any masks, vaccines, or quarantines. After contracting the disease, people either fully recover or die. A person can not be reinfected. After the simulation has occurred, you can see the graphs below the visualization that shows currently infected, recovered, and sadly died over time. In the real world, populations aren't isolated from one another. For example, one person can be infected but go to another place and spread the virus there.
